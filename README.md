> ℹ️ This is a Kirby CMS setup for a headless configuration based on the Kirby CMS Plainkit installation. The only installed plugin is KQL (Kirby Query Language) to enable POST requests to the Kirby API. A section for creating a user with read-only access has been added to the blueprint's configuration folder. Please note that this setup has been used primarily for small to medium-sized websites. It is a work in progress and may contain bugs.

## Installation
